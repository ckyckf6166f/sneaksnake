# Z5Bot
A script to glue the Telegram Bot API and Frotz together.  
Maybe an instance is running [right now](http://telegram.me/z5bot)!

## Screenshot
![it is actually able to run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sneaksnake/z5bot/master/media/demo-screenshot.png)  

At the time of writing, full documentation doesn't exist
and most stuff is hardcoded.
But if you want to give it a try anyway...

## Installation (sigh)
Put bot.py and dfrotz.py in a directory. Additionally, create  
- stories/zork_1-r52.z5 (z5 file containing Zork I)
- tools/dfrotz (Frotz compiled in dumb-mode / see Frotz Makefile)
- config.txt (a file JUST containing your Telegram API key)

in the same folder. Install python-telegram-bot and run bot.py.

(Don't) have fun. :D
